# nuridgeback_gazebo

# Overview
Simulate the Ridgeback in Gazebo. If you are looking to simulate the Sawback see the [sawback_description](https://github.com/bostoncleek/sawback_description) package. However this package was only tested on ROS Melodic it can still be used to simulate the Sawback in Gazebo. I did not end up adding a `sawback_gazebo` package to the [sawback](https://github.com/bostoncleek/sawback) package.

# Launch
To simulate the robot in gazebo:
```
roslaunch nuridgeback_gazebo nuridgeback_world.launch
```
